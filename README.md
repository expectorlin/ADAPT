# ADAPT

This is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper "ADAPT: Vision-Language Navigation with Modality-Aligned Action Prompts" (CVPR 2022).

## Prerequisites

### Installation
The environment installation of ADAPT follows that in [Recurrent-VLN-BERT] (https://github.com/YicongHong/Recurrent-VLN-BERT).

1.Install the [Matterport3D Simulator] (https://github.com/peteanderson80/Matterport3DSimulator). Notice that this code uses the [old version (v0.1)] (https://github.com/peteanderson80/Matterport3DSimulator/tree/v0.1) of the simulator.

2. the versions of packages in the environment can be found [here] (https://github.com/YicongHong/Recurrent-VLN-BERT/blob/main/recurrent-vln-bert.yml).

3. Install the [Pytorch-Transformers] (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) of [this version] (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/067923d3267325f525f4e46f357360c191ba562e).
